# Day-and-Night
I did this project on March 10, 2018, and it consists of a program made in Processing, which as the mouse moves over the relog, it marks the time in 24h or military format, also depending on the time the background changes representing whether it is of day or night, the clock is ticking from 2 am to midnight, and half of the clock is day and the other is night, the day begins at 6 am and ends at 6 pm and the rest of the time at night.
